# FanoBits

## Overview

FanoBits is a powerful text compression tool developed using the Shannon-Fano compression algorithm, implemented in C++. This tool provides efficient data compression, reducing the size of text files without losing any information, making it an ideal solution for applications where storage and bandwidth are limited.

## Features

**High Compression Efficiency:** Utilizes the Shannon-Fano algorithm to achieve substantial reduction in file size.

**Lossless Compression:** Ensures that the original text can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

**Fast Performance:** Implemented in C++ for optimal speed and performance.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## How it Works

The Shannon-Fano algorithm is a classic entropy encoding technique used for lossless data compression. The core idea is to build a binary tree where the most frequent characters are represented by shorter codes, and less frequent characters are represented by longer codes. This process results in compressed files that take up less space compared to their original counterparts.

## Applications

**Data Storage:** Reduces the amount of storage space required for text files.

**Data Transmission:** Decreases the bandwidth needed for transmitting text files over the network.

**Archiving:** Efficiently archives large collections of text documents.

**Embedded Systems:** Suitable for systems with limited memory and storage resources.
